# Hawaii Weather Analysis
module 9 challenge
## Goals
To identify key statistics for precipitation and temperature for June and December.
## Findings
On average, there is less rain in June than there is December although the temperature is not that different. The mean temperature in June is 74 degrees and 71 degrees in December, which is not too different. ALthough there is a wider range of temperatures in December. The mean precipitation in June is .136 and .216 in December, this is almost double the mean precipitation in June. The standard deviation is also greater for December (.36 vs. .54).
## Suggestions
Based on this, if P.Wavy's concerns are primarily with weather it doesn't have to be a deterent for his investment because the weather doesn't seem to fluctuate too much. The mean and median temperatures for both months are very similar, therefore, there is not reason to believe that there are significant outliers skewing this data. Although the amount of rain varies, the large difference between the median and mean amount of rain would suggest that there may be one or two days of heavy rain that are skewing the average for December higher. In fact, the medians for June and December are similar. Despite the higher average of rain, this is not necessarily a deterent to surfing as the external temperature is still the same.
