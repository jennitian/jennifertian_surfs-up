# Hawaii Weather Analysis
module 9 challenge
## Goals
To identify key statistics for precipitation and temperature for June and December.
## Findings
On average, there is less rain in June than there is December although the temperature is not that different. The mean temperature in June is 74 degrees and 71 degrees in December, which is not too different. Although there is a wider range of temperatures in December. The mean precipitation in June is .136 and .216 in December, this is almost double the mean precipitation in June. The standard deviation is also greater for December (.36 vs. .54).

Based on this, if W.avy's concerns for the surf shop are primarily with weather it doesn't have to be a deterent for his investment because the weather doesn't seem to fluctuate too much. Furthermore the median temperatures for both months are similar to the average temperature suggesting an even distribution of data. However, the difference between the mean and median rainfall for June and December are quite large, suggesting that there are outliers skewing the rain average for both months. In fact, the median values for June and December are similar (.02 and .03 respectively). If the average amount of rain in December is skewed by a few heavy rain days, business could run as usual for most days in December. 

## Future Directives
Further exploration of this dataset should examine the number of rainy days per month to determine whether heavy days of rain are the source of the skew in December and June. The search could also be expanded across all months to see whether the weather and rain is consistent across Spring and Fall seasons in addition to Summer and Winter. Information on beach traffic in the area where the business is planned to open could shed insight on how many surfers are visiting in these respective months. Information on tourism in Hawaii could also be used as a predictor for business in different seasons.
